# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was finding what to put in for hte variables because I am still learning python and do not understand most components of the code and how to format most things. I tried not to look at some parts of Mr.Bergs solution but couldn't figure out what to put because of not knowing most of the python language.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You would add a computer player to the game by asking the computer to fill any random spot that the user hasn't already filled out. 

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I think that in order for the computer to play the best, it would have to analyze the users placements first. The computer would play based off of the winning possibilities and which ever numbers are open. It would also analyze the winning posibilities for the user and purposfully block the user from the remaining number needed for the winning combo.
